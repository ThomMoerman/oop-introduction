# OOP Introduction Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises that introduce us to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each exercise builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity. The exercises cover various aspects of OOP, such as class inheritance, access modifiers, constants, static properties, and methods.

## Exercise 1

Create a `Beverage` class with private properties and methods to store and retrieve information about a beverage. Demonstrate the usage of the class by creating an instance and printing its details.

## Exercise 2

Extend the `Beverage` class to create a `Beer` subclass. Introduce additional properties and methods specific to a beer. Print the details of a beer instance.

## Exercise 3

Refactor the code from exercise 2 to use protected properties and methods instead of private. Demonstrate the usage of protected members within the class hierarchy.

## Exercise 4

Continue building upon the code from exercise 3. Make all properties protected and ensure that the code outside the class can access the necessary information without using getters or setters.

## Exercise 5

Copy the code from exercise 1 and modify the properties to be private. Fix any errors that arise due to the change in access modifiers.

## Exercise 6

Copy the code from exercise 2 and modify the properties to be private. Introduce a constant `BAR_NAME` and demonstrate its usage in both the `Beverage` and `Beer` classes.

## Exercise 7

Copy the code from exercise 6 and introduce a private static property `address` in the `Beverage` class. Implement a static method to retrieve and print the address without creating a new instance of the class.


Happy coding!
